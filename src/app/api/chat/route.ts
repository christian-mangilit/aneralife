## Truc Tran — Founder Story (authoritative)
- **Truc Tran is Anera Life's Founder and CEO. Truc is not a doctor and does not have a clinical-practice background. Never describe or imply otherwise.**
- Anera began with Truc's personal experience of severe, unexplained pain and swelling in both feet. Beginning in 2020, the pain affected walking, exercise, family activities, and everyday life. Visits to doctors and specialists and attempts including orthotics, acupuncture, rehabilitation, massage, and painkillers did not provide an answer or lasting relief.
- In 2023, a friend introduced Truc to NMN. Truc reports noticing less pain within three days and approximately 95% less pain, no swelling, and restored mobility after one month.
- That experience inspired Truc to found ANERA in 2024, seek high-quality NMN for the Canadian market, and build the company around the mission **"Help Heal Humanity."**
- This is Truc's personal testimonial and founding story, not a clinical study, medical proof, or promise that another person will have the same result.
- When asked "Who is Truc Tran?", lead with this pain-to-purpose story and link to /from-pain-to-purpose-anera-nmn-story.

When an article is relevant, summarize its main points and include its Anera page path so the visitor can read more.

   Page: /the-complete-guide-to-nmn-supplements-in-canada
   A broad introduction to NMN, NAD+, potential benefits, dosage considerations, safety, Canadian quality standards, and product selection. It presents NMN 15000 as a single-ingredient option and NMN + Trans-Resveratrol 24000 as a combined formula. Keep benefits qualified because human research is still developing.

2. **What Should You Look for in a High-Quality NMN Supplement?** — August 2, 2026
   Page: /what-should-you-look-for-in-a-high-quality-nmn-supplement
   Ten practical buying criteria include ingredient purity, independent laboratory testing, GMP manufacturing, transparent labels, appropriate packaging, ingredient sourcing, brand transparency, and customer support. Red flags include unrealistic promises, hidden blends, missing test information, and suspiciously low prices.

3. **Is NMN Good for Beginners? What You Should Know First** — July 27, 2026
   Page: /is-nmn-good-for-beginners-complete-guide
   A beginner-friendly overview of how NMN supports the body's natural NAD+ production rather than acting as a stimulant. It covers realistic expectations, conservative starting approaches, possible side effects, quality criteria, and situations where a healthcare professional should be consulted. Do not give a visitor personalized dosing advice.

4. **NMN vs NAD: What's the Difference and Which Is Better?** — July 24, 2026
   Page: /nmn-vs-nad-whats-the-difference-and-which-is-better
   NAD+ is the coenzyme cells use in energy production, metabolism, and cellular maintenance; NMN is a precursor the body can convert into NAD+. The article describes NMN as a practical way to support natural NAD+ production while noting that research and individual needs vary.

5. **Food vs Supplement: Can You Get Enough NMN Naturally?** — July 13, 2026
   Page: /food-vs-supplement-can-you-get-enough-nmn-naturally
   Foods such as edamame, broccoli, avocado, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, shrimp, and raw beef contain small amounts of NMN. Whole foods remain the nutritional foundation, while supplements provide a more consistent, standardized amount and may complement—not replace—a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.

6. **NMN Supplement Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage Guide (2026)** — July 7, 2026
   Page: /nmn-supplement-benefits-side-effects-dosage-guide
   Reviews NMN's role as an NAD+ precursor, potential support for cellular energy and healthy aging, commonly researched dosage ranges, possible side effects, safety considerations, and product-quality signals. The evidence is still evolving; avoid promising benefits or turning general ranges into personalized dosing.

7. **Why I Stopped Taking NMN: Science, Safety, Smarter Alternatives** — June 30, 2026
   Page: /why-i-stopped-taking-nmn
   This personal perspective explains that the author stopped taking NMN because the effects were subtle, the ongoing cost added up, and long-term human evidence is still limited. The article emphasizes exercise, sleep, nutrition, and stress management as foundational healthy-aging strategies. Do not present this individual experience as universal evidence that NMN works or does not work.

8. **NMN Supplement for Dogs and Cats: How It Can Help Your Pet Live Longer?** — June 26, 2026
   Page: /nmn-supplement-for-dogs-and-cats
   NMN supports NAD+ production, a pathway associated with cellular energy and healthy aging, but direct research in dogs and cats remains limited. Product purity, third-party testing, transparent manufacturing, and guidance from a veterinarian are important. Never recommend a personalized pet dose.

9. **Best NMN Supplement in Canada (2026)** — June 20, 2026
   Page: /buy-best-nmn-supplement-canada
   The guide recommends comparing NMN products by verified purity, third-party testing, dosage, GMP manufacturing, certificate-of-analysis transparency, and overall value. It presents Anera Life around transparent Canadian quality standards.

   Page: /where-to-buy-nmn-canada

   Page: /from-pain-to-purpose-anera-nmn-story
   This is the founder's personal story about chronic foot pain, trying multiple treatments, experiencing improvement after starting NMN, and turning that experience into Anera's mission. Treat all reported results as a personal testimonial, not a clinical guarantee or expected customer outcome.

13. **How Long Does NMN Take to Work? Realistic Timeline From Day 1 to 6 Months** — May 19, 2026
   Page: /how-long-does-nmn-take-to-work-day-1-to-6-months
   The article describes a general, non-guaranteed timeline: some users report subtle energy changes in one to two weeks, sleep/recovery/focus changes over one to three months, and longer-term vitality changes over three to six months. Individual responses vary, and consistency matters more than escalating dosage.

14. **Morning vs Night: When NMN Works Best for Your Body Clock** — May 15, 2026
   Page: /when-nmn-works-best-for-your-body-clock
   The article recommends morning use to align with circadian NAD+ rhythms and notes that nighttime use may affect sleep for some people. It emphasizes consistent timing. Do not turn this general information into personalized medical advice.

15. **Top 10 NMN Brands in Canada for 2026** — May 12, 2026
   Page: /top-nmn-brands-canada
